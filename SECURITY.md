# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a vulnerability in ExoMind, please use GitHub's [Security Advisories](https://github.com/zhugez/ExoMind/security/advisories) or email `security@exomind.dev` with an executable reproduction, the affected version, and any mitigation you have already tried. Avoid public issue threads so maintainers can respond securely.

## Supported Versions
Only the latest version published from the `main` branch is actively maintained. Please upgrade to the latest release before reporting an issue.

## Response Process
Once we receive a report, the maintainers will:
1. Acknowledge receipt within 72 hours.
2. Assess the report and, if confirmed, work on a fix or mitigation.
3. Coordinate a disclosure timeline, ideally alongside a patched release.
4. Update this policy if the supported version window changes.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

All participants in the ExoMind project are expected to respect the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1. The full text can be found at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.

## Our standards
We expect participants to:
- Be inclusive, welcoming, and collaborative.
- Be respectful and patient when communicating.
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- Report unacceptable behavior to the maintainers.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at `conduct@exomind.dev`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, emails, and chat channels) and at events organized by the project (meetings, conference talks, etc.).

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be removed or replaced.
